## 🧠 The Prompting Framework (Core Lesson)

To create **effective prompts**, follow this simple but powerful framework:

### **T C R E I**

**Task · Context · References · Evaluate · Iterate**

🧩 **Memory trick**:

> **Thoughtfully Create Really Excellent Inputs**

The order is flexible — what matters is the **quality and clarity** of what you provide.

---

## 1️⃣ Task — What do you want the AI to do?

Clearly describe the task you want the Gen AI tool to help with.

A strong task includes:

* **Persona** (who the AI should act as)
* **Format** (how the output should look)

### 🎭 Persona

Persona tells the AI *what expertise or perspective* to use.

Examples:

* “Act as a professional speechwriter”
* “You are a marketing executive with 15 years of experience”
* “Explain this to my manager”
* “Write for a customer audience”

The more specific the persona, the more tailored the output.

### 📐 Format

Format defines *how* the answer should appear:

* Bullet points
* Short paragraphs
* Table
* Outline

📌 Example:

> “Write the response as a table with three columns.”

---

## 2️⃣ Context — Give the necessary details

Context helps the AI **understand your situation**.

Compare:

* ❌ “Give me five birthday gift ideas.”
* ✅ “Give me five birthday gift ideas under $30 for a 29-year-old who loves winter sports and recently switched from snowboarding to skiing.”

➡️ More context = more relevant output

---

## 3️⃣ References — Show examples (Optional but powerful)

References give the AI **examples to learn from**.

You can include:

* Past examples
* Existing content
* Tone or style samples
* Descriptions of similar products

### 🎯 Few-shot prompting

* **Zero-shot**: no references
* **Single-shot**: one reference
* **Few-shot**: 2–5 references (sweet spot)

⚠️ Too many references may limit creativity.

---

## 4️⃣ Evaluate — Did it work?

After receiving the output, ask:

* Does this meet my goal?
* Is the tone right?
* Is the output usable?

Evaluation is where **critical thinking** comes in.

---

## 5️⃣ Iterate — Improve the prompt

If the output isn’t right:

* Add more context
* Adjust the persona
* Change the format
* Add or remove references

🔁 This is normal and expected.

> **Always Be Iterating (ABI)**

## 🏃 Framework in Action: Sneaker Example

### Step 1: Task only

> “Generate five ideas for a new high-performance sneaker line.”

Result: Decent, but too broad.

### Step 2: Add format

> “List the concepts and materials for each sneaker in an outline.”

Result: More structured and useful.

### Step 3: Add context

> “The sneakers are designed for athletes doing cross-training.”

Result: More targeted ideas.

### Step 4: Add references (Few-shot)

Provide descriptions of:

* A budget sneaker line
* A shoe with an adaptive sole

Prompt:

> “Keep the five ideas but refine them using these examples as references.”

Result: Creative, relevant, and high-quality outputs.

## 🔁 Evaluation & Iteration in Practice

You’ve already been iterating if you:

* Reviewed early outputs
* Added context
* Added references

Iteration happens **throughout**, not just at the end.

---

## 💡 Expert Prompting Tips (Google Productivity Advisors)

* More context = better results
* Treat prompting as an **ongoing conversation**
* Start with a persona:

  > “Imagine you are a world-class marketer…”
* Include:

  * Budget
  * Timeline
  * Company values
  * Past work

You can even:

* Upload documents
* Share existing project plans
* Ask the AI to expand or improve what already exists

---

## 🧠 Prompting Best Practices

* Start simple
* Add complexity gradually
* If quality drops, simplify again
* Experiment freely

Learning what works (and what doesn’t) is part of the journey.
