## 🌟 Course Purpose (Big Picture)

This course teaches **how to communicate clearly with Generative AI** so you can get **better, faster, and more reliable results**.

Prompting is not about tricking AI — it’s about **giving clear instructions**, just like you would to a teammate.

By the end of this course, you will:

* Understand the difference between a *good* prompt and a *great* prompt
* Use a **repeatable prompting framework**
* Apply Gen AI to real work tasks (writing, planning, data, presentations)
* Build a skill that is becoming a **new language of computing**

---

## 🤖 What is Generative AI?

**Generative AI (Gen AI)** is a type of AI that creates *new content* based on user input.

It can generate:

* Text (emails, summaries, plans)
* Images
* Audio & video
* Code

🧠 **Important term**:
The input you give to Gen AI is called a **prompt**.

---

## ✍️ What is Prompting?

**Prompting** is the process of giving **specific instructions** to a Gen AI tool to:

* Get new information
* Complete a task
* Produce a desired output

A **prompt** = instructions + context + expectations

> Prompting is both an **art** (how you phrase things) and a **science** (structure and clarity).

---

## 💡 Why Prompting Matters (Real Example)

📌 **Problem**: Team members shared meeting availability in messy chat messages
📌 **Solution**: Used Gen AI to:
* Organize responses into a table
* Sort availability by date

⏱️ What would take *forever manually* took **minutes with AI**.

➡️ This course is about turning **daily headaches into easy tasks** using Gen AI.

---

## 🧩 Remember:: Prompting = Helping a Teammate

Prompting works best when you:

* Give **context**
* Set **clear parameters**
* Explain the **goal**

Just like onboarding a teammate to a project.

❌ Vague instructions → weak output
✅ Clear instructions → strong output

---

## 🧠 Prompting Framework (Core Skill)

You will learn a **prompting framework** — a formula for writing great prompts.

You will:

* Use it throughout the course
* Improve prompts through **iteration** (first try doesn’t have to be perfect)
* Evaluate and refine until the output matches your need

✨ Iteration is **part of the process**, not a failure.
