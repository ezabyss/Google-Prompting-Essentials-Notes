# Prompting for Visuals: Modalities & Image Generation

## 🌟 Big Idea

Images and visuals can be just as important as words when communicating ideas.
This lesson explains how to use generative AI tools to create **visual outputs**, especially **images**.

---

## 🧠 What are Modalities?

**Modalities** are the different formats that generative AI tools can **receive** or **produce**.

Common modalities:

* Text
* Images
* Video
* Audio
* Code

### Key reminder

Different gen AI tools are better at different modalities.
➡️ Always check what modalities your tool supports.

## 🖼️ Image Generation (What AI can create)

Some gen AI tools can generate images like:

* A sunrise
* A bouquet of flowers
* A crab riding a dolphin

But they can also create professional visuals for:

* Business use
* Posters
* Presentations

---

## 🎸 Example Use Case: Concert Poster

Scenario: A musician is playing a gig in **New Orleans** and wants a poster.

This lesson compares prompting for:

* **Text output** (headlines)
* **Image output** (poster image)

---

## ✍️ Prompting for Text (Text-Based Modality)

Text prompts work best when you:

* Clearly state the **task**
* Add **context**

### Example prompt (task)

> “Generate headlines for a poster promoting a rock concert in New Orleans.”

### Add context

> “The concert is one night only, and the headlines should encourage the audience not to miss out.”

Result: Gemini can generate catchy poster headlines.

## 🖼️ Prompting for Images (Image Modality)

When prompting for an image, you still follow the same framework, but you must use **more vivid descriptions**.

### What image prompts need

* Size (if needed)
* Color
* Position (foreground/background)
* Style (photographic, illustration, etc.)
* Aesthetic and mood (exciting, calm, futuristic, etc.)

---

## ✅ Example Image Prompt (Task + Style + Details)

> “Generate an image of an electric guitar for a poster. It should be a photographic style.”

Add vivid description:

* “The guitar should be glittery or sparkly and create a sense of excitement.”
* “The guitar should be in the foreground and give a sense that it’s floating in the sky.”

Result: The tool can generate multiple image variations.

---

## 🔁 Iterating Image Prompts (Refine for Better Results)

To improve an image, evaluate the output and then add new details.

### Example refinement

If you like the guitar but want more drama:

> “Now, make the sky stormy with lightning hitting the guitar.”

You can repeat this cycle:

1. Generate
2. Evaluate
3. Add relevant details
4. Generate again

---

## 🧠 Memory Anchors

* **Modalities** = formats (text, image, audio, video, code)
* Text prompts: clear **task + context**
* Image prompts: need **vivid visual details** (style, position, mood)
* Better images come from **iteration**
