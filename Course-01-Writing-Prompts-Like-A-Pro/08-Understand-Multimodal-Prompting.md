# Understanding Multimodal Prompting

*Notes by: Abhishek (EzAbyss)*

## 🌍 We don’t experience the world using only words.

In real life, we combine:

* Text
* Images
* Audio
* Visual layouts

**Multimodal prompting** works the same way — it uses **multiple types of media together** to guide a generative AI tool.

---

## 🧠 What Is Multimodal Prompting?

**Multimodal prompting** means using **more than one modality** in a single prompt.

### Modalities = formats such as:

* Text
* Images
* Audio
* Video

➡️ When you combine them (for example, image + text), you are using **multimodal prompting**.

---

## 🔑 Why Multimodal Prompting Matters

Multimodal prompting allows you to:

* Transfer information from one medium to another
* Save time on explanation
* Get more accurate, detailed outputs

It reflects how humans naturally communicate and understand information.

---

## 🏢 Workplace Use Cases

Multimodal prompting is especially useful at work.

Examples:

* Take a photo of a **chart** and ask AI to explain it in plain language
* Upload **logo options** and ask for new design directions
* Record **audio in another language** and ask for transcription

---

## 💅 Example: Image + Text → Text Output

Scenario: You’re an entrepreneur selling nail art.

### Input:

* An image of the nail art
* A text prompt

**Prompt:**

> “Write a social media post featuring this image. The post should be fun, short, and focus on the fact that this is a collection of new designs I’m selling.”

### Why it works

Even with an image reference, you still:

* Specify the **task**
* Add **context**
* Include a **format**

The AI analyzes the image and produces a caption.

---

## 🎯 Enhancing Multimodal Prompts

If you want a specific voice or tone:

* Add past captions as references
* Share written examples along with the image

This helps the AI match your brand style.

---

## 🗺️ More Multimodal Examples

Multimodal prompting shines when converting information:

* Photo of a city map → list of landmarks
* Audio file → key insights
* Office floor plan image → list of room names

---

## 📅 Example: Image → Table

Scenario: You receive a **conference schedule image**.

**Prompt:**

> “Extract the times of the keynote speaker and two panel discussions from this schedule into a table.”

Why it works:

* Task is clear
* Format is specified
* Image provides the reference

You can then iterate further (for example, draft an email from the table).

---

## 🎨 Think Like an Artist

You *can* create something with one color — but more colors give more power.

Same with prompting:

* Text-only prompts are powerful
* Multimodal prompts unlock **more possibilities**

> You’re the artist. The gen AI tool is your paintbrush.

## ⚖️ Benefits and Limitations

### Benefits

* More vivid outputs
* Clearer instructions
* Better alignment with real-world tasks

### Limitations

* AI may struggle with abstract ideas
* Complex modality combinations can be difficult
* Multimodal prompting is not reliable for precise counting

---

## 🧩 Common Multimodal Prompting Scenarios

* Suggest recipes from a **photo of fridge ingredients**
* Generate event visuals using **two brand logos**
* Write a story inspired by **audio recorded in a forest**

---

## 🧠 Using the Prompting Framework with Multimodal Prompts

You still use:

**Thoughtfully Create Really Excellent Inputs**

But adjust each part slightly:

### Task

* Be specific about **how and why** each modality is used

### Context

* Clarify constraints related to the modalities
* Example: only consider fruits and vegetables in a fridge image

### References

* Can be text, images, or audio
* Make sure the tool supports the references you provide

### Evaluate

* Review carefully across all modalities
* Visual + textual outputs may need extra checking

### Iterate

If output misses the mark:

* Revisit the framework
* Break into smaller tasks
* Add constraints
* Rephrase or use an analogous task

---

## 🔑 Memory Anchors

* Multimodal = multiple formats in one prompt
* Best for transferring information across media
* Framework still applies
* More modalities = more creative power
