# The Four Iteration Methods (ABI)

*Notes by Abhishek (EzAbyss*

## 🌟 Core Idea

Sometimes a prompt **doesn’t give the output you want**.

Instead of deleting everything and starting from zero, use:

> **ABI = Always Be Iterating**

Meaning: **shape the prompt step-by-step** until the output becomes useful.

---

## ✅ Method 1: Revisit the Prompting Framework

If results are weak, check whether your prompt has enough specificity in:

* **Task**
* **Context**
* **References**

### Example

❌ Too vague:

> “Give me five blog post ideas.”

✅ Improved (adds persona + format + audience):

> “You are an expert on sports nutrition. Provide five **blog post headlines** that summarize the biggest trends happening in the industry for an audience of **physical therapists working with professional basketball players**.”

---

## ✅ Method 2: Split the Prompt into Shorter Sentences

If your prompt has multiple tasks, break it into smaller prompts.

### Long input (too many tasks at once)

> “Summarize the key data points and information in this report. Then create visual graphs from the data and shorten the key information into bullets.”

### Break it into steps (submit as separate prompts)

1. “First, summarize the key data points and information in this report.”
2. “Then create visual graphs with the data you summarized.”
3. “Finally, shorten the key information you summarized into bullets.”

### Why it helps

Shorter prompts can be more precise because the AI can handle **one small task at a time**.

---

## ✅ Method 3: Change Phrasing or Use an Analogous Task

If you’re stuck, try:

* Different phrasing
* A similar task that’s different enough to trigger a new response (**analogous task**)

### Example

Instead of:

> “Write a marketing plan for a product or service.”

Try:

> “Write a story about how this product fits into the lives of our target customer demographic.”

This changes the approach, which can lead you closer to a useful output.

---

## ✅ Method 4: Add Constraints to Focus the Output

If outputs feel boring or too obvious, introduce constraints.

### Example

You’re making a road trip playlist, but the suggestions are too familiar.

Add constraints like:

* Only artists from a certain region
* Only artists who released music in the last five years

Constraints help the AI narrow its output and generate something **more helpful or unique**.

---

## 🧠 Memory Hook

When output isn’t good, remember **ABI** and choose one:

1. **Framework check** (Task / Context / References)
2. **Split into steps**
3. **Rephrase / analogous task**
4. **Add constraints**

---

## 🔑 Final Line

The better you **evaluate** and **iterate**, the better your output will be.
