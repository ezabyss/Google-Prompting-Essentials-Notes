# Expert Advice: Iteration & AI Limitations

*Insights from Anoop — Research Director, AI and Future Technologies (Google)*

---

## 🌟 Core Message

Generative AI tools are **powerful but not perfect**.

They can sound **extremely confident**, even when they are wrong.

➡️ That’s why **human judgment + iteration** are essential.

---

## ⚠️ AI Is Not Ground Truth

Anoop highlights an important warning:

* AI may write text that *sounds very confident*
* Confidence ≠ correctness
* AI outputs should **never be treated as ground truth**

### What this means for you

* Always **double‑check facts**
* Your subject knowledge is critical
* AI suggestions require human review

---

## 🔍 Why Fact‑Checking Matters

Mistakes don’t always look obvious.

Some errors are:

* Subtle
* Hidden inside well‑written paragraphs
* Easy to miss if you blindly trust the output

➡️ Knowing your topic helps you **catch errors early**.

## 🔁 Prompting Is an Iterative Process

Prompting is **not one‑and‑done**.

Anoop explains:

* The first prompt is just a starting point
* Real value comes from **iterating forward**
* Each iteration extracts better help and clearer answers

> Think of prompting as a **conversation**, not a command.

---

## 💬 Prompting = Ongoing Conversation

Good prompting looks like:

1. Start with an initial prompt
2. Review the output
3. Adjust the prompt
4. Refine again

This loop continues until:

* The output solves the task
* The information is accurate
* The result matches your intent

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways (Memory Friendly)

* AI is confident, not perfect
* Never treat AI output as truth
* Always fact‑check
* Prompting requires iteration
* Better prompts come through conversation

---

## 🔑 Final Reminder

> AI helps you think — **you are still responsible for the result**.

Iteration + evaluation are what turn AI output into real value.
