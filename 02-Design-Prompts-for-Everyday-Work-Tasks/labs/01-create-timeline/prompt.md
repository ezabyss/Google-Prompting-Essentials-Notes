Create a detailed timeline table for launching a new clothing collection for my small business.

Business context:

Target audience: middle-income customers aged 18–39

Style focus: minimalist designs with current fashion trends

Planned launch: early September (fall season)

Current month: March

Timeline requirements:

Cover the full 6-month period from March to September

Break the timeline into monthly phases (with key tasks and milestones)

Include design, sourcing, manufacturing, marketing, and launch preparation

Constraints to account for:

Lead designer unavailable from June 16 to July 20 (plan design work accordingly)

Fabric shipping delays: 6 weeks instead of the usual 2 weeks

Manufacturer will be changed to a new supplier with more competitive pricing

Please adjust the schedule realistically to account for these constraints and include buffer time where necessary.
