# AI Prompting Timeline Lab

## Overview
This lab demonstrates the use of a structured prompting framework (TCREI: Task, Context, Reference, Evaluate, Iterate) to create a project timeline using a generative AI tool.

The goal of this activity was to practice writing clear prompts with constraints and to reflect on how prompt design affects AI-generated outputs.

## Skills Practiced
- Prompt engineering
- Applying constraints in AI prompts
- Timeline and project planning
- Self-reflection on AI outputs

## Framework Used
**TCREI Prompting Framework**
- Task
- Context
- Reference
- Evaluate
- Iterate

## Contents
- `prompt.md` → Final version of the AI prompt
- `timeline-table.md` → Generated timeline table
- `reflection.md` → Personal learning reflection
