## Purpose
This module explains how generative AI can be used as a practical productivity assistant in everyday work, especially for research, writing, planning, and brainstorming.

## Key Problem
Professionals often receive more information (emails, papers, tasks) than they can process deeply in limited time.

## Role of Generative AI
Generative AI helps by:
- Summarizing long or complex content
- Answering follow-up questions interactively
- Helping users quickly understand new topics
- Supporting creativity and productivity

## What You’ll Learn
- How to prompt AI effectively
- How to summarize research papers
- How to write better emails
- How to brainstorm ideas
- How to build schedules
- How to take meeting notes efficiently

## Beginner-Friendly Advice
Instead of asking “What can AI do?”, ask:
“What am I already doing that AI can help with?”

## Practical Productivity Tip
Use AI alongside your existing to-do list to:
- Draft emails
- Research topics
- Kickstart projects
- Organize thoughts

## Core Takeaway
Generative AI works best when it supports your current workflow rather than replacing it.
