# 🧑‍💼 AgentX — Your Personalized Expert Consultant
*Getting High-Quality Feedback with Generative AI*

---

## 🌟 What Is AgentX?
AgentX is the second major type of AI agent, designed to act as a **personalized expert or consultant**.

Unlike simulation agents (like AgentSim), AgentX focuses on:
- Evaluating work
- Providing expert critique
- Asking strategic follow-up questions
- Highlighting gaps and improvements

📌 **Key Insight:**  
AgentX helps you see your work through an expert’s eyes.

---

## 🧠 When to Use AgentX
AgentX is especially useful when you need:
- Feedback on pitches or proposals
- Strategic critique
- Expert-level questioning
- Perspective-taking (e.g., client, executive, reviewer)

It works best when:
- The task involves lots of context
- You want nuanced, role-based feedback
- You need iterative refinement

---

## ⚠️ Long Context Window Reminder
Expert feedback often requires:
- Detailed briefs
- Background documents
- Full drafts or pitches

📌 **Important:**  
Not all generative AI tools support long context windows.  
Use a tool that can retain and reference large amounts of information across the conversation.

---

## 🧪 Example Use Case: Client Pitch Feedback

### 📌 Scenario
You are pitching a creative campaign to a potential client.

You want the AI to:
- Act like the client
- Critique your pitch realistically
- Ask follow-up questions
- Highlight weaknesses
- Summarize improvements at the end

---

## 🧠 Designing AgentX (Step-by-Step)

### 1️⃣ Define the Persona
Tell the AI *who it is*.

> You are my potential client, the VP of advertising at a world-famous sports car company known for innovation, performance, and engineering excellence.

---

### 2️⃣ Set the Scene (Context)
Describe the situation clearly.

> You are considering hiring a creative agency to develop a new campaign aimed at attracting a younger generation of buyers.  
> You are meeting with me, the design director of a creative agency, who is pitching a new campaign.

---

### 3️⃣ Define the Agent’s Behavior
Be explicit about how the agent should interact.

> Act as my potential client.  
> When I respond, critique my answers if needed and ask relevant follow-up questions.

---

### 4️⃣ Provide Reference Material
Attach supporting documents to ground the feedback.

> I’ve included the client brief with all relevant information.  
> Use this brief to inform your critique and responses.

📌 **Why This Matters:**  
Grounding feedback in real documents improves accuracy and relevance.

---

### 5️⃣ Set a Stop Rule
Control when the interaction ends.

> Continue the conversation until I say **“BREAK.”**

---

### 6️⃣ Define the Final Output
Tell the agent what to do after stopping.

> After I say BREAK, summarize the entire conversation and highlight specific ways I can improve my pitch.

---

## ▶️ Running the Conversation
Once started, AgentX will:
- Ask probing questions
- Surface concerns
- Push for clarity and strategy
- Challenge assumptions
- Reflect real client expectations

📌 **Outcome:**  
You get realistic, pressure-tested feedback before a real meeting.

---

## 🧠 Evaluating AgentX Feedback
After stopping the interaction:
- Review what’s working
- Identify gaps and risks
- Note repeated concerns

This helps you refine:

---

## 🔁 Iterating with AgentX
You can:

- Ask for feedback again
- Test alternative approaches

📌 **Pro Tip:**  
Save strong AgentX prompts so you can reuse them for future pitches.

---

## 🧩 Custom AI Agents
Some platforms allow you to save customized AI agents by:
- Defining their role
- Specifying tone and behavior
- Reusing them across projects

This lets you build:
- A “client reviewer” agent

- A “creative director” agent

📌 **Think of agents as reusable tools, not one-time prompts.**
