# 🧩 Solving Complex Problems with Prompt Chaining
*Building Solutions Step by Step with Generative AI*

---

## 🌟 What Is Prompt Chaining?
Think about solving a **jigsaw puzzle**:
- You don’t dump all the pieces together and hope for the best
- You start with corners or edges
- You build small sections
- Then connect them into a complete picture

📌 **Prompt chaining works the same way.**

Prompt chaining guides a generative AI tool through a **series of connected prompts**, where:
- Each prompt builds on the previous response
- New context or tasks are added gradually
- Complex problems are solved step by step

---

## 🧠 Prompt Chaining vs Iteration
Although they sound similar, they serve different purposes:

### 🔁 Iteration
- Refines a **single prompt**
- Adjusts wording, format, or focus
- Improves one output

### 🔗 Prompt Chaining
- Uses **outputs as inputs** for the next step
- Expands scope gradually
- Builds toward a larger, multi-part solution

📌 **Key Insight:**  
Iteration improves results; prompt chaining builds systems.

## 🤖 Why Prompt Chaining Is Powerful
Prompt chaining helps when:
- Tasks are complex or multi-stage
- Context matters across steps
- You want consistency across outputs
- You’re working toward a final deliverable

Examples:
- Catching up after time off
- Research and decision-making
- Content creation workflows
- Planning multi-step projects

---

## 🧪 Everyday Example: Catching Up After Time Off
You can chain prompts like this:

1. **Prompt 1:** Summarize emails and documents received
2. **Prompt 2:** Focus on time-sensitive or urgent items
3. **Prompt 3:** Suggest actions to address the urgent issues
4. **Prompt 4:** Draft responses or next steps

📌 Each step builds on the previous one.

---

## 🧠 Prompt Chaining with Long Context
Prompt chaining works best when the AI tool:
- Can remember earlier messages
- Maintains context across the conversation
- Supports longer inputs

⚠️ **Reminder:**  
Not all AI tools have long context windows. Check tool capabilities.

## 📖 Example: Marketing a Novel Using Prompt Chaining

### 📌 Scenario
You’ve finished writing a novel and now need to:
- Market it
- Promote it
- Plan a book tour

This is a perfect use case for prompt chaining.

---

### 🔗 Step 1: Generate a Catchy Tagline

**Task Prompt:**
> Generate three options for a one-sentence summary of this novel manuscript.  
> The tone should match the manuscript but be more catchy and engaging.

---

### 🔗 Step 2: Refine the Tagline
Use the previous output as context.

**Follow-Up Prompt:**
> Create a single tagline that combines the best elements of the previous three options, focusing on plot twists and mystery.  
> Keep it concise and impactful.

📌 Now you have a strong marketing hook.

---

### 🔗 Step 3: Expand into a Book Blurb

**Next Prompt:**
> Create a five-sentence summary of the entire manuscript that expands on the one-sentence summary.

📌 The tagline becomes the foundation for a richer description.

---

### 🔗 Step 4: Build a Promotional Plan
With the manuscript, tone, and summary already understood:

**Next Prompt:**
> Generate a six-week promotional book tour plan, including locations to visit and marketing channels to use for each stop.

📌 A full marketing plan emerges from chained prompts.

## 🔁 Flexibility Within Prompt Chaining
At any stage, you can:
- Iterate on a single step
- Adjust tone or format
- Add new constraints
- Continue the chain further

Prompt chaining is **structured but flexible**.

---

## 🧠 Best Practices for Prompt Chaining
- Start with a clear goal
- Break the goal into logical steps
- Use previous outputs as building blocks
- Add new tasks gradually
- Evaluate accuracy at each stage
- Be mindful of hallucinations
- Save important outputs externally

---

## 💬 Key Takeaways
- Prompt chaining solves complex problems step by step
- Each prompt builds on previous outputs
- It differs from simple iteration
- Long context improves effectiveness
- Prompt chaining supports planning, creation, and decision-making
- Human judgment is essential throughout

---

## ❓ Reflection Question
What complex task could you simplify by breaking it into steps and using prompt chaining instead of a single prompt?
