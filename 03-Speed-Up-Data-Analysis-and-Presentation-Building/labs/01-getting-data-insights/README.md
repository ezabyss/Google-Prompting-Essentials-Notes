# AI Prompting – Data Insights Lab

## Overview
This lab focuses on using the TCREI prompting framework to extract insights from a dataset using a generative AI tool capable of analyzing structured data formats.

The objective was to design an effective prompt, apply constraints, and analyze AI-generated insights while reflecting on the prompting process.
